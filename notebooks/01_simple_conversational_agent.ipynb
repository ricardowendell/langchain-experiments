Refresh the page, check Medium 's site status, or find something interesting to read. LangChain is an open-source framework designed for developing applications powered by a language model. You can utilize its capabilities to build powerful applications that make use of AI models like ChatGPT while integrating with external sources such as Google Drive, Notion, and Wikipedia. LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model, but will also be: Data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data Agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment Introduction. Langchain is an open-source framework that enables developers to combine large language models, such as GPT-4, with external sources of computation and data. Offered as a Python or a JavaScript package, the popularity of this framework has skyrocketed after the introduction of GPT-4 in March 2023.\u001b[0m\n",
